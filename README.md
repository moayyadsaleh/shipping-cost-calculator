# shipping-cost-calculator
In this project, I've developed a dynamic web application using Node.js that allows users to effortlessly perform unit conversions and calculate shipping costs. My friend challenged me to create this application, and I'm excited to share it with you.

 Key Features:
Express Framework: I've leveraged the power of Express for Node.js, to build the foundation of this application.

EJS Templates: The application uses EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templates to render dynamic HTML content, providing a seamless user experience.

CSS Styling: With a strong focus on responsive design principles, I've meticulously crafted CSS styles that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. Whether the user is using a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, the application provides an optimal viewing and interaction experience.

Unit Conversion: Users can easily convert between pounds and kilograms, as well as between US dollars and Jordanian Dinars. The application uses precise conversion functions for accurate results.

Shipping Cost Calculation: With just a few clicks, users can calculate shipping costs based on weight and currency preference.

 How It Works:
Open the application and navigate through the intuitive interface.
Choose your preferred unit conversion or shipping cost calculation option.
Sellect the required values and select the units or currency.
Submit the form, and voil√†! You'll instantly see the converted values or the calculated shipping cost.
